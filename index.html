                  <h4>Current Research </h4>
                   Software development is all about the product, people, and processes. In this scenario, most projects use code review as a way to improve the final quality of their codebases. Although been proven to be useful, research still lacks knowledge on how it can be effectively applied in real-world scenarios, and how this affects other important parameters in the development phase. By analyzing software products and mining both their review data and linked information about development, the aim is to get a better insight on how code review can affect the product, the people, and the process. Furthermore, the target is to assess if and where the review process has some issues, which are its causes and to what extent this impacts different software metrics.

                      <b>Mock or Not to Mock</b><br />In general software testers need to test classes that include a lot of dependencies. To not rely on these dependencies, which slow down the testing process, devs use mock objects. We want to present a qualitative and quantitave study that investigate how mocks are currently used in open-source projects. We analyze how the usage of mocking frameworks affect test quality and conduct qualitative research to understand why/what/when developers use mocks.<br /><br />
                      <b>Qualitative study on "Collaborative Testing" </b><br />
                      With this research I want to investigate what can be improved in terms of testing in the cloud, especially taking in consideration the aspect of collaboration. I am doing a qualitative research study interviewing developers from various companies, asking how they test in the cloud and which tool they use to collaborate withing their team.

                  Researchers are investigating a large number of approaches to support quality of software products. One of the latest deep improvements comes with the practice of Modern Code Review. It is systematic examination aimed to discover mistakes, improve the overall quality of software, and enhance transfer knowledge. Although code review has been proven to be useful in its base nature, some improvements may be applied to enhance the quality of the software and obtain better benefits from that process. In this track, we tackle aspects of the code review and connected topics to improve this process.

                  <h4>Current Research </h4>
                  Software development practices have evolved quite a lot since the early days of
                  programming. Most software projects today, especially in the open source software
                  community, are using distributed and agile development practices. In addition, heavily 
                  rely on reusing external software libraries to realise part of their functionality,
                  rather than needing to implement these functionalities themselves. The goal of this
                  research is to empirically study how software library are used in open source projects,
                  and to recommend improvements in such library usage by providing automated tools
                  to support developers of software projects and software libraries.

                  <h4>Current Research </h4>
                  When looking at the performance in software development, several parameters are of relevance like effort in development and maintenance, effort in code review, time in fixing errors, time to design and implement new specifications, etc. In the case of a cloud software, where continuous deployment and continuous development are common, time-to-deployment is usually a very important metric. It involves changes to the source code that fix bugs or implement new features. In this research line, we are interested in exploring those metrics, and what impacts them, with the scope of to raising specific indicators that characterize performance in these processes. The reasons that guided the choice is that software product line development is still a time and effort consuming activity, partly due to the complicated mapping between model and implementation.

                  <h4>Current Research </h4>
                  An increasing number of artifacts are now being produced in digital form. Apart from software code, examples include books, ledgers, microchips, 3D printed objects, and films. The quality of an artifact's digital representation can affect both its external quality and the efficiency of associated processes, especially if it is frequently used, reused, or edited. Towards this goal, the fellow is exploring diverse alternatives to propose an internal quality assessment models. Developing a quality model for diverse digital artifacts presents a unique challenge as the model must be applicable to heterogeneous domains yet must handle the intricate domain details affecting the quality of the artifact. Initial exploration has revealed a few alternatives; specifically, quality analysis approach based on cognition, the theory of "order", and statistical inference. The fellow plans to carry out a deep dive comparative study into each of the alternative approaches. Based on the results of the comparison, the fellow plans to focus on one approach, implement corresponding tool support, and perform a detailed evaluation.

                  <h4>Current Research </h4>
                  Nowadays, Cloud Computing is increasingly adopted by many organizations and scientific domains, following the rising demand for internet services. Its evolution is undoubtedly at its peak and
			many researchers focus on the study and improvement of cloud technologies from different perspectives. However, the data-centers, which are the primary hosts of Cloud systems and applications,
			are energy hogs and major drivers for ITâ€™s carbon footprint in the atmosphere.
			In this line, providing energy-efficient development for Cloud systems is of paramount importance to ensure sustainability in terms of their economic and environmental impact.
			We aim to provide SE (Software Engineering) patterns and techniques in order to reduce energy dissipation of Cloud-based Systems.
			The researcher has initially conducted an extensive research and literature review in the field of energy efficient software development in order to identify in more detail the research gap to be addressed during this PhD project.
			The study showed that the problem of code-level optimization techniques to improve energy efficiency is already extensively covered in the literature, due to its relevance with code-level optimization techniques for performance
			improvement, which is a problem investigated widely by software engineering researchers in the last years. In this line, the PhD student will focus on investigating SAS (Software Architecture Styles) such as: pipeline, map-reduce,
			micro-services, OOP, SOA, etc., as a means to improve energy consumption of cloud-based software. Each of the SAS choices has its own benefits, although, their trade-offs can vary significantly over energy consumption.
			To the best of our knowledge, this topic is poorly covered by the literature and there is significant potential on the expected research outcomes.

                  <h4>Current Research </h4>
                   Virtualization is the main software technology used to support the cloud computing model. Its goal is to manipulate
			a shared pool of configurable computing resources and allow the coexistence of several isolated systems on a single
			physical machine1. However, virtualization comes with a number of considerations with respect to security.
			Compared to the bare metal servers, the use of Virtual Machines (VMs) and light-weight Linux containers
			increases the attack surface of the system since virtualization technologies provide access for multiple
			services to the same physical resources. A vulnerability exploited in virtualized/contained multi-tenant systems
			can cause data-leakage, denial-of-service or violation of privacy3 issues to more than one entities. According
			to a 2015 survey, conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, Data Security was the highest rated concerns for
			businesses that were considering to adopt cloud computing services. Several practical and theoretical techniques
			have been introduced for mitigating the risks, with most of them focusing on securing the traditional virtual
			machine host and guest environments, however, there is little evidence in the literature on the security
			characteristics of both hypervisor and container technologies.
			In this line, this PhD work focuses on the study and analysis of security characteristics of cloud-based
			systems utilizing hypervisor and container technologies. In particular, the fellow will investigate the
			security properties of modern micro-services architectures, running in containerized environments and will
			analyze their operation and security vulnerabilities in complex service ecosystems, where legacy systems
			and micro-services co-exist.

              <h3>Process Quality</h3>
              <h4>Process quality in cloud-related software development projects</h4>
              With so many enterprises having an increasingly large fraction of
              their business dependent on cloud-related applications, in many
              cases using continuous deployment techniques, the quality of the
              development processes producing those applications becomes of
              paramount importance. Not only classical approaches to quality
              need to be adapted to the cloud development environments (such as
              process quality assurance), but also new approaches should be
              developed (such as the detection of bad process smells, which
              allows for taking preemptive actions, or the characterization of
              development performance, which allows to detect good practices).
              To be of practical use, these quality-improving and
              quality-assuring techniques have to be reflected in adequate
              tooling, that can be of use in current development environments.

                  <h4>Bad process smells in software development repositories</h4>
                  Similar to how "code smells" help to find constructs in
                  source code that could be more error-prone, "process smells"
                  help to detect patterns in software development processes
                  that could lead to errors.  To detect them, information is
                  extracted from software development repositories (source code
                  management systems, issues tracking system, code review
                  system, etc.), and analyzed with statistical and other
                  techniques. The detection of these patterns can lead to take
                  early corrective actions, which are very important specially
                  in systems with high time-to- deploy constraints, such as
                  those related to cloud computing.

                  <h4>Quality assurance of software-defined cloud infrastructure </h4>
                  A driving objective within the cloud computing domain is the
                  full automation of the process of deploying software
                  components onto the underlying computing infrastructure.  For
                  example, the "software-defined data center" is a vision where
                  all IT infrastructure components are virtualized and
                  available as services. The deployment of software systems is
                  then a fully automated process, defined in software that
                  brings together the necessary virtual infrastructure
                  components as well as the application components to provision
                  a complete IT system.  New tools and languages are under
                  active development to support this vision. The aim of this
                  research is to extend quality assurance techniques available
                  for "traditional" software components to software-defined
                  infrastructure components. For example, techniques for
                  reviewing, testing, and measurement must be rethought,
                  redeveloped, and revalidated to allow assurance of
                  reliability, maintainability, security, portability, etc.
                  specifically on the software that defines cloud
                  infrastructure components and deployment processes.

                  <h4>Characterization of performance in key parameters of software development</h4>
                  Key performance indicators are used by the industry to make
                  decisions. In the specific case of software development, it
                  is also necessary to have this type of indicators to help
                  third parties interested in investing resources/participating
                  or fostering the use of specific technologies, to fully
                  understand the risks associated to that product. This is even
                  more marked in the case of open source projects, where
                  development may be community or company driven and third
                  parties contribute to the source code. Thus, the raise of
                  specific indicators for software development and more
                  specifically in open source projects, will help to facilitate
                  the decision process for stakeholders and improve the
                  attractiveness of those projects offering such information to
                  those stakeholders.

              <h3>Process Quality</h3>
              <h4>Quality in cloud-related software development</h4>
              Cloud applications are usually complex pieces of software, build
              by loosely coupled, geographically distributed, large teams of
              developers. These developers work in many different domain areas
              and have to keep-up with the pressing needs of a quickly-evolving
              industry, while at the same time keeping quality and performance
              under control. In this environment, casual information obtained
              by just &ldquo;keeping an eye&ldquo; on the project quality is
              less than enough.  Methodical approaches, supported by tools that
              deal with the rich information obtained from software
              repositories, are needed to have a complete view of how a project
              is behaving, evolving and performing. This work package will
              address these needs by looking at specific aspects of the
              problem, and providing comprehensive solutions.

                  <h4>Impact of code review in cloud computing development</h4>
                  Most large software development projects use code review to
                  improve the quality of the code changes merged to the main
                  code base. Yet, little is known on how this process affects
                  to important parameters of development and deployment
                  processes. By analyzing code review repositories, and other
                  repositories with information about development and
                  deployment, we expect to better understand how code review
                  affects to the whole development and deployment process, when
                  bottlenecks are caused, when unnecessary delays are found,
                  how expensive code review is in terms of impact on different

                  <h4>Improving cloud-related testing practices</h4>
                  Software engineering is a team effort: Sometimes even
                  hundreds of professionals collaborate to devise, build,
                  evaluate, and modify a software system. To support teamwork
                  in software development, industry is creating new integrated
                  development environments (IDEs) in the cloud, which offers a
                  better platform for synchronous development.  The current
                  state of the practice is to have a sort of &ldquo;Google Docs
                  for code.&rdquo; The aim of this research is to investigate
                  how to use cloud-based IDEs to improve testing practices.
                  Specifically, it will qualitatively and quantitatively
                  investigate how testing is currently performed in cloud-based
                  IDEs. Then it will investigate how to reuse test run
                  information across developers, to better link tests and
                  program components.  This will help, for example, to
                  eliminate the unnecessary time spent in the same tests on the
                  same code, thus reducing the time to check the quality of

                  <h4>Data driven development software in cloud-related software development projects</h4>
                  The main goal of this line is to define a method to help
                  developers to obtain indicators about how the software
                  development is being undertaken. Typical methods are focused
                  on the quality of the product and its evolution, but not in
                  the community around the product and how developers interact
                  among them. This method should specifically help open source
                  projects to understand, measure and improve their software
                  development process.  Once this process will be driven by
                  metrics, it will help, for example, to avoid issues, to
                  detect specific deviations from the arranged issue tracking
                  system policy, and to check the health of the demographics of
                  the community among other facts. This data driven development
                  can lead to faster decision-making process especially in
                  continuous deployment contexts, such as in industries related

	      Progress in the IT industry is no longer guided by

                  <h4>Configuration management and administration of cloud computing systems</h4>
                  Currently cloud computing systems are in the Cambrian
                  explosion phase programming languages and processor
                  architectures were at the dawn of computing. Tens of cloud
                  providers offer services under a variety of models, with
                  their systems requiring configuration and administration in
                  disparate ways. This is the expected outcome of rapid
                  innovation in a new era, but it has costs. Systems and skills
                  built associated with each provider lack portability tying
                  them to a specific one, while the market's fragmentation
                  increases costs and undermines the ability to innovate at
                  higher levels of the infrastructure stack. The aim of the
                  proposed research is to identify the high-level portable
                  building blocks that can be used for building and managing
                  computing systems on the cloud in a way that satisfies sound

                  <h4>Energy-efficiency of cloud computing systems</h4>
                  Energy consumption attributable to IT systems is significant
                  and increasing at an alarming rate. Decades of
                  resource-agnostic development of software systems have
                  contributed to this trend. Ongoing improvements of
                  energy-efficiency at the hardware and data center level
                  threaten to be canceled out by wasteful software. Cloud
                  computing has been identified as a development that may help
                  to curb this trend, but naive use of cloud infrastructures
                  may actually have the opposite effect, for instance due to
                  increased data traffic, insufficient elasticity, or
                  additional virtualization layers. The aim of this research is
                  to provide software engineers with techniques to measure
                  energy consumption, identify energy leaks, and optimize
                  consumption without compromising competing quality attributes
                  such as performance and reliability. These techniques enable
                  the cloud to realize its energy-saving potential.

                  <h4>Secure systems on cloud computing infrastructures</h4>
                  A basic tenet of IT security is that if an attacker has
                  access to the physical assets of a computing system all bets
                  are off regarding the confidentiality, integrity, and
                  availability associated with the services it provides. This
                  need not be so. It has been for decades a theoretical
                  possibility and a practical reality to communicate reliably
                  over noisy channels, and to perform accurate computations
                  with unreliable building blocks. Recent theoretical advances
                  suggest that performing secure computations on insecure
                  infrastructures is also possible. The aim of this research is
                  to develop and combine theory and practice that will allow
                  the construction of secure systems on top on an inherently
                  insecure cloud computing infrastructure. On the theoretical
                  front the research will explore the limits of what levels of
                  security guarantees can be provided given specific adversary
                  capabilities, while on the practical front the research will
                  examine how these guarantees can be implemented in the form
                  of useful building blocks.
